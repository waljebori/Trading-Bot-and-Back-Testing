# Trading-Bot-and-Back-Testing
Working on an automated trading bot using Binance as the exchange and a strategy I found online. My main focus at the present time is backtesting the strategy and
optimizing various parameters to return the most succesful historical results. Once I am satisfied with the win-rate and the gain on the account using the historical
data, I will deploy the strategy live on Binance using their API. The plan is to trade BTC-USD as there are zero trading fees on that pair, and it is high liquidity.
The backtesting.py file has a list of comments near the top of updates/improvements I am planning to make. Feel free to reach out about any questions
